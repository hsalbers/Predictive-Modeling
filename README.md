# Predictive-Modeling
Project Description: Create a script that employs two or more of the predictive Machine 
Learning models (preferably more than two) that we have discussed in class to analyze a 
business situation of your choosing. Your model(s) must be predictive. The script you 
submit must compute an assessment of the test error rate, preferably across various model 
types and/or levels of flexibility.
